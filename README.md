A linked list is a data structure of nodes that each point to the next. Its usedul for searching through faster than something like an array.
Also more effecient with insertions and deletions. Its important a node references the immediate next node in order to maintain structure and prevent
issues like an infinite loop. Looking into things, a linked list would be extremely effecient for a to-do list for its linear execution and need to
insert regularly. A list or array may be more effecient if you are traversing a small amount of data.
